# Parcellation

Parcellation file subdividing the whole-cortex into 300 regions (grouped into 7 networks) is provided in `cifti/`. The files were converted to `.csv` format for easy usage.

The original files are located in [this repository.](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal/Parcellations/HCP/fslr32k/cifti) More details here:
